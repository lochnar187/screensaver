# screensaver
WPF C# screensaver, Paranoia RPG themed.
A Free Fan Art Project

Displays a huge eye that tracks around the screen and the pupil dilates.  This is the Computer.  The Computer will talk every so often, saying one of about 40 different things.  Includes a retro effect, scanlines like the old CRT monitors had.

There are many settings to play with.  You can turn off the talking or adjust the frequency the Computer will speak, making it a short as every 30 seconds or as long as every 10 minutes.  You can also turn off the retro effect if it bugs you too much.  There is a reason monitors don't do that anymore :)

Limited testing has been done because I only have one machine to test with.  So feel free to contact me if you have a problem.  I can't guarantee a solution but what could it hurt to try.  I'll respond as free time allows.
